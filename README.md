This project focuses on analyzing Uber trip data using Python and machine learning to extract meaningful insights about ride patterns and demand. The analysis includes preprocessing raw trip data, handling missing values, and formatting timestamps for temporal analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to identify peak hours, most active locations, and high-demand days. Visualizations help reveal trends in user behavior, such as ride frequency by time of day and day of the week. Feature engineering techniques are used to enhance the dataset and improve model accuracy. Machine learning models like Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor are implemented using scikit-learn to predict trip demand. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error and R-squared score. The project is organized in Jupyter Notebooks for easy visualization and step-by-step understanding. Overall, this project demonstrates how data science can help improve ride-sharing efficiency and strategic decision-making for transportation services.
